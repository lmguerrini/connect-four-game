# Connect Four Game

Connect Four Game made during my Full-Stack Web Developer Bootcamp at [Spiced Academy](https://www.spiced-academy.com/en/program/full-stack-web-development/berlin) in Berlin. <br /><br />
Connect Four is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens.
